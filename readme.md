First of all, a big thank you to the authors of the github page github.com/ome, I used one of their example files : "FileConvert.java" for this project.

This is the first release, on the 21/02/2022, a few days after the project was initially started.
It might not work on MacOs but works on Windows and Linux without problem.

To get a list of all the commands, execute the file with the option --help
